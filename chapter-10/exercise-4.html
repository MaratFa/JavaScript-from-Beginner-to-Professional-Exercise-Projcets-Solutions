<!-- 1. Create a simple HTML file to work on. -->
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <!-- 2. Add three HTML elements adding the same class to each. You can use
    different tags as long as the same element class is included. Add some
    content within each element so you can distinguish between them. -->
    <h1 class="example">H1 tag</h1>
    <h2 class="example">H1 tag</h2>
    <h3 class="example">H3 tag</h3>
  </body>
  <!-- 3. Add a script element to your file, and within it select the page elements by
  class name. Assign the resulting HTMLCollection values to a variable. -->
  <script>
    let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("example");
    // 4. You can use an index value to select the individual HTMLCollection items,
    // just as you would for array items. Starting with an index of 0, select one
    // of the page elements with the class name and output the element into the
    // console.
    for (el in elements) {
      console.log(elements[el]);
    }
