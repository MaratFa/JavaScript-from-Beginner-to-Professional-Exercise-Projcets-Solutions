1. Go to your favorite website and open the browser console. Type document.
   body. What do you see in the console?
2. As we know, with objects, we can write to the property value and assign a
   new value with the assignment operator. Update the textContent property
   of the document.body object on a web page of your choosing to contain the
   string Hello World.
3. Use what we learned about objects to list out BOM object properties and
   values. Try it on the document object.
4. Now do the same for the window object.
5. Create an HTML file with an h1 tag. Use JavaScript and select the page
   element with the h1 tag and assign the element into a variable. Update the
   textContent property of the variable to Hello World.
